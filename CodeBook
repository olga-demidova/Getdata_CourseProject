The resulting data base has 75 variables.
1. subject - A variable showing which subject (by number from 1 to 30) of those participated in the experiment the data describe.
2. activity_label - A variable describing which activity was performed by the subject (6 options: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS)
3-69. Average mean and average standard deviation for each of the following signals estimating variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
